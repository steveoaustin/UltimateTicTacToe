        <strong>How to play:</strong><br>
        Ultimate tic-tac-toe is a game that combines the fun 
        fast pace of tic-tac-toe with a more strategic element,
        like chess. Your goal is to get three in a row in the 
        large board by winning individual sub-boards, but be careful,
        your move in each board dictates where your opponent can move 
        next. For example, if you play in the top left square of a board,
        your opponent will be able to play anywhere in the top left board
        on their turn.
        <br><br>
        You will play each turn in the board highlighted in purple.
        The computer will move automatically after you do.
